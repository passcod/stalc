## Lexer

1. **Whitespace** is defined as being one or more of any of the 25 Unicode
   whitespace characters: horizontal and vertical tab, newline sequences, the
   various typographic spaces and quads, the line and paragraph separators, and
   the Ogham space mark.

2. All whitespace is ignored, _except_ for whitespace contained in strings.

3. Thus, **tokens** are any contiguous sequence of non-whitespace characters,
   as well as strings in their entirety.

4. **Strings** are delimited by U+0022: `"`. They may contain any character,
   including all whitespace, but `"` and U+005C `\` both need to be escaped by
   a preceding `\`.

5. Tokens may be either strings, **literals**, or **commands**. Both strings
   and literals are precisely defined; anything that's not one of these may be
   considered a command.

6. Commands may have an optional argument list appended immediately following
   the commands, without intervening whitespace, delimited by U+0028 `(` and
   U+0029 `)`. The argument list may be empty. Arguments are separated by
   whitespace. E.g. `command()`, `command(arg)`, `command(arg arg)`.

7. Argument lists may contain any type and sequence of tokens.

## Literals

### Numerals

1. Numerals are U+0030 to U+0039 `0123456789` (**numerics**), U+0041 to U+005A
   `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ` (**uppercase letters**), and U+0061 to U+007A
   `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz` (**lowercase letters**).

2. Numbers can be written either in decimal, unary, or with an arbitrary radix
   between 2 and 62 inclusive. Radii 2 through 10 use only numerics, radii 11
   through 36 use numerics followed by case-insensitive letters, radii 37
   through 62 use numerics followed by uppercase letters followed by lowercase
   letters.

3. The special **unary radix** uses `1` as its only numeral.

### Numbers

1. Numbers are written with a **sign prefix**, an **integer part**, a
   **fractional part**, and a **radix suffix**, in this order. All parts are
   optional, but there must be at least one of the integer part or the
   fractional part.

2. The **sign prefix** is either U+002B `+` or U+002D `-` or U+2212 `−`.

3. The **integer part** and the **fractional part** are each a non-empty
   sequence of numerals.

4. Numbers are assumed to be in decimal unless a **radix suffix** is present.
   This suffix is a U+005F `_` followed by one or two decimal numerals.

5. The integer and fractional parts are separated by a **radix point**, either
   U+002E `.` or U+002C `,`.

6. A number without a fractional part may have a trailing radix point suffixed
   onto its integer part, and a number without an integer part may have a
   leading radix point prefixed onto its fractional part.

### Booleans

1. Booleans are written using either `true` or `false`.

### Dates

1. Dates are written in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) full
   calendar format, with hyphens, using decimals. That is, an optional **sign
   prefix**, a **year**, a hyphen, a **month**, a hyphen, and a **day**.

2. The **sign prefix** is as defined in [Numbers::2]().

3. The **year** is at least four decimal numerals. Years below 1000 and greater
   than −1000 must be left-padded with zeroes, as in ISO 8601.

4. The **month** must be two decimal numerals. Months below 10 must be
   left-padded with a zero. Months must be between 1 and 12 inclusive.

5. The **day** must be two decimal numerals. Days below 10 must be left-padded
   with a zero. Days must be at least 1, and at most 28, 29, 30, or 31
   depending on the month.
