## Lexer

1. **Whitespace** is defined as being one or more of any of the 25 Unicode
   whitespace characters: horizontal and vertical tab, newline sequences, the
   various typographic spaces and quads, the line and paragraph separators, and
   the Ogham space mark.

2. All whitespace is ignored, _except_ for whitespace contained in strings.

3. Thus, **tokens** are any contiguous sequence of non-whitespace characters,
   as well as strings in their entirety.

4. **Strings** are delimited by U+0022: `"`. They may contain any character,
   including all whitespace, but `"` and U+005C `\` both need to be escaped by
   a preceding `\`.

5. Tokens may be either strings, **literals**, or **commands**. Both strings
   and literals are precisely defined; anything that's not one of these may be
   considered a command.

6. Commands may have an optional argument list appended immediately following
   the commands, without intervening whitespace, delimited by U+0028 `(` and
   U+0029 `)`. The argument list may be empty. Arguments are separated by
   whitespace. E.g. `command()`, `command(arg)`, `command(arg arg)`.

7. Argument lists may contain any type and sequence of tokens.

## Literals

### Numerals

1. Numerals are U+0030 to U+0039 `0123456789` (**numerics**), U+0041 to U+005A
   `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ` (**uppercase letters**), and U+0061 to U+007A
   `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz` (**lowercase letters**).

2. Numbers can be written either in decimal, unary, or with an arbitrary radix
   between 2 and 62 inclusive. Radii 2 through 10 use only numerics, radii 11
   through 36 use numerics followed by case-insensitive letters, radii 37
   through 62 use numerics followed by uppercase letters followed by lowercase
   letters.

3. The special **unary radix** uses `1` as its only numeral.
